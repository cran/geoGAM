Description: A model building procedure to build parsimonious geoadditive model from a large number of covariates. Continuous, binary and ordered categorical responses are supported. The model building is based on component wise gradient boosting with linear effects, smoothing splines and a smooth spatial surface to model spatial autocorrelation. The resulting covariate set after gradient boosting is further reduced through backward elimination and aggregation of factor levels. The package provides a model based bootstrap method to simulate prediction intervals for point predictions. A test data set of a soil mapping case study in Berne (Switzerland) is provided.
